<p>Nim is a programming language that is awesome like Ruby, but is compiled and typed which makes it about as fast as C or C++, and often a bit faster than Rust or Go, and usually about ten times faster than Python or Ruby.</p>

<p>This site is open source and editable by anybody! Just fork the <a href="https://github.com/zachaysan/nc">repo</a> and initiate a pull request! The source is in Markdown and the website is currently writtin in Nanoc, but once Nim has a nice static site compiler weâ€™ll switch over to a Nim based one.</p>
