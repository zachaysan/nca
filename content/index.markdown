# Searchable answers to common Nim questions

Do you ever feel like Stack Overflow should just let users create questions and answers at the same time? That is why this website, Nim Community Answers, exists. So we don't have to have [silly arguments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/948135/how-can-i-write-a-switch-statement-in-ruby) about whether something is an appropriate question.

Nim is a programming language that is awesome like Ruby, but is compiled and typed which makes it about as fast as C or C++, (usually) faster Rust or Go, and usually ten times faster than Python or Ruby. I'm keeping a list of the cool features as I build this site [here](/cool_things/).

This site is open source and editable by anybody! Just fork the [repo](https://github.com/zachaysan/nca) and initiate a pull request. The source is in Markdown and the website is currently written in [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/), but once Nim has a nice static site compiler we'll switch over to a Nim based one.

It is a complete coincidence that both this site and [Nim by Example](https://nim-by-example.github.io/) are created with the same static site compiler. The main difference between the two sites are that Nim by Example is created as an introduction or beginner's, while this site is more of a quick reference for impatient polyglot programmers.
