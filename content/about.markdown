# About Nible Nim Community

The Nimble Nim Community (or Nimble Nim for short) was started by Zach Aysan so he could make Nim solutions Googleable after he solved them the first time. By open sourcing the project, everyone can help create a better Nim.

Zach can be found on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/zachaysan).

Feel free to email him as well: zachaysan@gmail.com is where he is currently found.
