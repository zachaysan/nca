# About Nim Community Answers

I started Nim Community Answers (nca for short) as a little project so I could make Nim solutions Googleable after I solved them for the first time. This project is open source, so feel free to fork and pull request or even just raise an issue if there is an answer you are having trouble finding.

I can be found on Twitter as [zachaysan](https://twitter.com/zachaysan).

And you can email me here: zachaysan@gmail.com if you have a longer question.
